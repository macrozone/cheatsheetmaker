cheatsheetmaker
===============

A tool to create "cheatsheets" or other documents with focus on academic content. You can write documents with markdown, 
it also supports math-formulas in Tex-notation (using [mathjax](mathjax.org)).

It is also possible to add images by "drag'n drop" into the browser window.

Work in progress.
